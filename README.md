# Parametr-calibration-of-CT-system-and-image-reconstruction

When the CT system is installed, there are often errors, which affect the imaging quality. Therefore, the installed CT system needs to be parameterized, that is, the parameters of the CT system are calibrated by means of a sample of known structure (called a template), and the unknown structure is accordingly The sample was imaged.
Please establish the corresponding mathematical models and algorithms to solve the following problems:

Q 1
-----
Place a calibration template consisting of two uniform solid media on a square pallet. The geometric information of the template is shown in Figure 2. The corresponding data file is shown in Annex 1. The value of each point reflects the absorption intensity of the point. It is called "absorption rate". The receiving information corresponding to the template is shown in Annex 2. Based on this template and its received information, determine the position of the CT system's center of rotation in the square tray, the distance between the detector units, and the 180 directions of the X-rays used by the CT system.


Q 2
----
Annex 3 is the reception information of an unknown medium obtained by using the above CT system.
Using the calibration parameters obtained in (1), information such as the position, geometry, and absorption rate of the unknown medium in the square tray is determined. 
In addition, please specify the absorption rate at the 10 locations given in Figure 3.
The corresponding data file is shown in Annex 4.

Q 3
-----
Annex 5 is the reception information of another unknown medium obtained by using the above CT system. 
Using the calibration parameters obtained in (1), the relevant information of the unknown medium is given. 
In addition, please specify the absorption rate at the 10 positions given in Figure 3.

Q 4
---
Analyze the accuracy and stability of parameter calibration in (1). 
On this basis, design new templates and establish corresponding calibration models to improve the calibration accuracy and stability, 
and explain the reasons.
